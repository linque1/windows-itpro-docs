# Manage connection endpoints for Windows 10 Enterprise, version 2004

**Applies to**

- Windows 10 Enterprise, version 2004

Some Windows components, app, and related services transfer data to Microsoft network endpoints. Some examples include:

- Connecting to Microsoft Office and Windows sites to download the latest app and security updates.
- Connecting to email servers to send and receive email.
- Connecting to the web for every day web browsing.
- Connecting to the cloud to store and access backups.
- Using your location to show a weather forecast.

Details about the different ways to control traffic to these endpoints are covered in [Manage connections from Windows operating system components to Microsoft services](manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services.md). 
Where applicable, each endpoint covered in this topic includes a link to the specific details on how to control that traffic. 

The following methodology was used to derive these network endpoints:

1. Set up the latest version of Windows 10 on a test virtual machine using the default settings. 
2. Leave the device(s) running idle for a week ("idle" means a user is not interacting with the system/device).
3. Use globally accepted network protocol analyzer/capturing tools and log all background egress traffic.  
4. Compile reports on traffic going to public IP addresses.
5. The test virtual machine(s) was logged into using a local account, and was not joined to a domain or Azure Active Directory.
6. All traffic was captured in our lab using a IPV4 network. Therefore, no IPV6 traffic is reported here. 
7. These tests were conducted in an approved Microsoft lab. It's possible your results may be different.
8. These tests were conducted for one week, but if you capture traffic for longer you may have different results.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft uses global load balancers that can appear in network trace-routes. For example, an endpoint for *.akadns.net might be used to load balance requests to an Azure datacenter, which can change over time.

## Windows 10 2004 Enterprise connection endpoints

|Area|Description|Protocol|Destination|
|----------------|----------|----------|------------|
|Apps|||[Learn how to turn off traffic to the following endpoint(s).](manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services.md#bkmk-windowsstore)|
||The following endpoint is used for the Weather app. To turn off traffic for this endpoint, either uninstall the Weather app or disable the Microsoft Store. If you disable the Microsoft store, other Store apps cannot be installed or updated. Additionally, the Microsoft Store won't be able to revoke malicious Store apps and users will still be able to open them.|HTTPS|tile-service.weather.microsoft.com
||The following endpoint is used for OneNote Live Tile. To turn off traffic for this endpoint, either uninstall OneNote or disable the Microsoft Store. If you disable the Microsoft store, other Store apps cannot be installed or updated. Additionally, the Microsoft Store won't be able to revoke malicious Store apps and users will still be able to open them.|HTTPS|cdn.onenote.net/*
||The following endpoint is used by the Photos app to download configuration files, and to connect to the Office 365 portal's shared infrastructure, including Office in a browser. To turn off traffic for this endpoint, either uninstall the Photos app or disable the Microsoft Store. If you disable the Microsoft store, other Store apps cannot be installed or updated. Additionally, the Microsoft Store won't be able to revoke malicious Store apps and users will still be able to open them.|TLSv1.2|evoke-windowsservices-tas.msedge.net|
|Certificates|The following endpoint is used by the Automatic Root Certificates Update component to automatically check the list of trusted authorities on Windows Update to see if an update is available. It is possible turn off traffic to this endpoint, but that is not recommended because when root certificates are updated over time, applications and websites may stop working because they did not receive an updated root certificate the application uses. Additionally, it is used to download certificates that are publicly known to be fraudulent. These settings are critical for both Windows security and the overall security of the Internet. We do not recommend blocking this endpoint. If traffic to this endpoint is turned off, Windows no longer automatically downloads certificates known to be fraudulent, which increases the attack vector on the device.||[Learn how to turn off traffic to all of the following endpoint(s).](manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services.md#automatic-root-certificates-update)|
